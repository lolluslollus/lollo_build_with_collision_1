# lollo_build_with_collision_1
This is a mod for Transport Fever 2, to build certain objects even if they collide or cause other minor errors.
Turn the function on or off with the blue icon in the bottom bar.
There is another mod that is supposed to do the same, but I could never bring myself to like it, so I redid it.
